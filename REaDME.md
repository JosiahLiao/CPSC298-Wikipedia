# Title: Democratic Contributions on Controversial Articles
## Group Members: Josiah Liao
## Abstract
Our project seeks to understand how democratic Wikipedia is, especially in regard to controversial articles. Wikipedia is run by a community of editors who provide knowledge for articles, but often these communities turn open-editing areas into oligarchical elitist places, disallowing new or differing input. In order to quantify this, we want to explore the variance in individuals who edit articles relative to the article's editing activity. This is a simple statistic to quantify, so we may expand the scope of this project to include studying the editing activity of active editors and how communities form regarding different subjects and fields of expertise.
