Wikipedia as a platform is built upon the principles of democracy and open contributions. In this sort of environment, communities will inevitably form around shared interests or subject matters. However, the way communities are formed around different articles and subjects, as well as the way these communities interact with each other, is a fascinating topic for study. In this paper we use Wikipedia's user databases paired with computational graphing to study how communities are formed and how users interact within different Wikipedia communities. We retrieve data on users' edits on different articles, as well as interactions on articles' talk pages and other users' talk pages. By processing this data, we can analyze the ways different users are grouped around other users and around various articles. [Leave room for summary of findings; results have not been gathered yet]
