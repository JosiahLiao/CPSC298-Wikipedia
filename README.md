# Democratic Contributions on Controversial Articles
## Group Members: Josiah Liao
## Abstract
Our project seeks to understand how democratic Wikipedia is, especially in regard to controversial articles. Wikipedia is run by a community of editors who provide knowledge for articles, but often these communities turn open-editing areas into oligarchical elitist places, disallowing new or differing input. In order to quantify this, we want to explore the variance in individuals who edit articles relative to the article's editing activity. This is a simple statistic to quantify, so we may expand the scope of this project to include studying the editing activity of active editors and how communities form regarding different subjects and fields of expertise.
## Research Questions
- What is the distribution of power clusters in various areas of Wikipedia?
- How do different subjects vary in "gatekeeping" edits or accepting newcomers?
- What insights can be gained by studying communities on Wikipedia?
## Methodology
We plan to gather data from Wikipedia on user activity as well as page activity. We will use community/graph visualization software and certain statistics to hopefully gain insight into Wikipedia's community structure and overall democratic qualities.
## Python Program
The Python test program gathers the edit history of 5 active (50+ edits) users at random and dumps the data to a file. Note: This program was created with the use of AI tools.
