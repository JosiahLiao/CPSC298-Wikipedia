ABSTRACT
The gender gap in participation on Wikipedia is well established.
The impacts of the participation bias on content may be expressed
through a number of different behaviors. This research considers
potential content biases that may result from efforts to delete
content. We collect deletion data on a sample of article pages
selected based on a method designed to identify content of likely
interest to a specific group of people; men and women in this case.
The analysis illustrates that there does not appear to be a
systematic bias resulting in more deletions or nominations for
deletions against content of likely interest to women. We consider
how these results improve our understanding of bias and the ways
peer production systems can mitigate the potential for biases.

INTRODUCTION
Sara loves to cook. She’s been hearing about the trendy “mug
cakes” and wants to learn more about them. She knows that
Wikipedia is a good source for information. She navigates to
Wikipedia and enters “mug cake” in the search bar. Her search
yields a page of search results, but no page for mug cake. This
causes Sara to wonder why there is no page for mug cakes?

One of Wikipedia’s stated goals is to be a repository of all
human knowledge. That there is no article specifically on Sara’s
desired topic is a concern. Understanding how and why some
content is omitted from the encyclopedia is an important
question. It could reflect
•
Gaps in the experiences and knowledge of those
who create and edit content,
•
Aspects of collective decision-making processes, or
•
Specific biases of the collective or broader more
pervasive societal biases from which individuals
would have trouble breaking free.
Wikipedia is a peer production community which means that it
relies on the voluntary contributions of many people. It seems
natural that those volunteers will create and edit content that
specifically interests them. Further, when deciding whether some
content merits inclusion into the encyclopedia it would seem
obvious that those volunteers would feel more confident about
the merits of some content over other content.
In the case of Wikipedia, a common result of contributor
surveys indicates that 80% or more of the contributors are male.
This “gender gap” in participation raises the specter of broad
potential biases in the encyclopedic content. Prior studies have
validated the existence of biases. One study considered
biographies of women scientists and found that the women
covered were more globally notable than the men covered in
similar articles [16]. Another study based on articles about
movies of supposed interest to men and women found that men
and women Wikipedia editors have slightly disparate category
foci with men editing more in Geography and Science and
women editing more in People and Arts [11].
While these studies importantly point to challenges for the
encyclopedia’s content, they also illustrate some challenges in
assessing systemic biases. One challenge is in the scope of the
existing bias. Wikipedia covers a wide range of topics and
claiming systemic bias based on samples of narrow topics might
be overgeneralizing. A second challenge is how to operationalize
the bias. Most prior studies have often focused on “acts of
omission.” That is, they have sought to understand what content
is missing. An act of omission may be somewhat innocent
because individuals just may not know what should be included.
“Acts of commission,” the behavioral activities within Wikipedia
that may be resulting in systemic biases are less frequently
studied. Another study of biographies of women scientists found

OPENSYM, August, 2020, Madrid, Spain
that articles appeared to mention familial ties, specifically
marital status more frequently for women when compared to
men [15]. These differences are created by the editors as a
function of their work activity. An act of commission in this case
is reflective of the behaviors of the editors and makes visible
biases that become incorporated into the encyclopedia.
We note that in raising this behavioral view of biased
production we are specifically trying to avoid ascribing intent by
the individual editors. Systemic biases may be a function of an
individual's environment and, as such, it may be very difficult for
individuals to see in themselves. The potential here is that by
taking a clear analytical stance, maybe research can uncover
ways that systemic bias happens during peer production and
then work to develop techniques to mitigate and, potentially,
correct systemic biases over time. Thus, the focus of this
research is to consider one particular behavior that may be
leading to systemic biases in Wikipedia content. Specifically, we
attempt to answer:
Is content supposedly of more interest to women
being actively deleted from Wikipedia?
In the following sections we first cover some prior work that
has considered deletion activity, aspects of systemic bias, and the
gender gap on the English Wikipedia. We then describe the
methods of this study. Our approach builds off a previous
method to measure topical representativeness [12]. Our research
uses that method to identify content that is likely to be of
interest to women or men. Our elaboration then explores if
efforts to delete content demonstrate behavioral content biases
which may reflect systemic biases on Wikipedia. We close with
some discussion that considers other places where systemic
biases might be observed through actions taken by Wikipedia
editors.

Considering Deletion and Bias
With over 5 million articles on the English-language version
alone, Wikipedia editors create hundreds of pages a day and also
delete hundreds of pages a day [10]. As such, pages not found on
Wikipedia may have existed at one time, but have been removed
as a result of a deletion. Previous work has detailed the processes
involved in assessing whether an article fits the project’s
encyclopedic standards [5]. Debates around what is considered
encyclopedic and to whom the content is important surround the
complex norms in the types of articles that are nominated for
deletion [5]. When an article is deleted from Wikipedia, it is
most commonly the result of one of three different processes:
Proposed deletion (WP:PROD), speedy deletion (WP:CSD) or
article for deletion (WP:AfD)1. The procedures for all three are
well documented and generally reflect a deliberative process that
focuses on the individual merits of any given topic. For the

purposes of this work, we focus on speedy deletion (CSD) and
article for deletion (AfD) activities as those processes are
currently reflected in logs of Wikipedia activity. PROD was not
included in the deletion logs when this study was conducted.
Wikipedia exists in a difficult tension. On the one hand the
goal of the encyclopedia is to contain the sum of all human
knowledge. On the other hand, some topics have very minor
value in the big scheme of things. This tension is reflected in a
long running debate on Wikipedia between “inclusionism” and
“deletionism.” The debate hinges on where one stands with
regard to the idea of “notability.” In Wikipedia, a topic merits
inclusion in the encyclopedia if it satisfies a complex set of
criteria described in the notability policy (WP:NOTE)2.
Inclusionists support a more liberal take on the concept of
notability and advocate for “lower entry barrier rates” for
including topics. By contrast, deletionists support a more
selective understanding on the concept of notability and are
“motivated by a desire that Wikipedia be focused on and cover
significant topics.” Prior work that considered how the decisions
to delete articles were resolved showed that individual biases
were at play in the decision making. Preference statements to
keep or delete articles were subject to prior biases to keep or
delete and herding, wherein groups of like-minded individuals
all visit the same discussion; a study reveals that both had
affected the final outcome of keeping or deleting a page [14].
Prior work provides some insight on other potential impacts
on how deletion decisions are being made. The formalization of
norms on Wikipedia through strict guidelines and procedures
has discouraged newer editors from contributing to some of the
key decision-making processes, including deletion decisions [7].
The consequence of excluding newcomers is that perspectives
that are not part of the existing views of editors or topics with
which current editors are not familiar have a harder time being
included. Another study that considered the “long tail” of less
popular content noted that the number of articles being deleted
was increasing due to the “lack of notability” [10]. This further
suggests a resistance to certain topics by the editors. This
resistance to certain topics points to potential biases being
systematic in the way the community and its processes function.

Systemic Bias, Systematic Bias, and The
Gender Gap
A bias can be systematic without yet being systemic. When a
bias becomes rationalized as part of a decision or embodied in
some piece of code, it clearly becomes systematic. Further, when
that biased decision-making process is broadly adopted, say in a
peer production community, or that little piece of code is widely
applied to a platform, then the bias is more deeply ingrained in
the social or technical system and it is better to describe that bias
as systemic.
Two projects start to illustrate the subtle differences. One
piece of work considered the development of articles over time

and how they would become more elaborate as a function of
developing the content. This ‘knowledge maturation’ model
highly correlated with the time that the article spends in
existence, resulting in a type of bias toward keeping ‘mature’
articles over potentially less mature and shorter-lived topics [2].
A slightly different view considered how different cultural and
historic perspectives were present in the Polish edition of
Wikipedia and related that to existing systemic biases in culture
[3].
When noting the participation gender gap, popular media has
often attributed gaps in content as resulting from targeted
harassment of editors. One specific example pertains to the
Gamergate controversy that began in 2014, where women in the
video game industry were targeted leading to the decline of their
games and input into the industry. These specific harassment
efforts led to the deletion and removal of content presumed to be
of interest to women [8,9]. And the popular press is not alone in
suggesting that deletion is a potential way to identify bias. In
unpacking the ways in which different systematic biases may be
present on Wikipedia, previous work has cited deletion of
content as a possible result or indicator of systemic bias [13].
The Wikipedia community has been concerned that systemic
biases are undermining the encyclopedic content. Members of
the community formed a WikiProject, a type of virtual team,
focused on identifying and mitigating systemic biases.
WikiProject Countering Systemic Bias3 considers all systemic
biases but has a strong justification for their work based on the
existing gender gap and well publicized anecdotes that illustrate
enactments of one or more biases—often biases focused at
women or on topics that are of supposed interest specifically to
women.
If one key way to counter a systemic bias is to rally
supporters and effect positive change, then that implies one
needs to have the participation of individuals who can see and
clearly articulate the nature of the systemic bias. Prior work that
has studied the participation gender gap has illustrated the
different, systematic and systemic ways that some individuals
are discouraged from full participation in Wikipedia [7]. A study
by Collier et al. [4], considered whether differing participation
resulted from either (1) the high levels of conflict in discussions,
(2) dislike of critical environments, (3) lack of confidence in
editing other contributors' work, or (4) that women have less
discretionary time. In sum, Collier et al. found that participation
was significantly discouraged by the contentious and conflictdriven nature of Wikipedia.
In the popular media, one well known debate centered
around whether the deletion of a Wikipedia article about Kate
Middleton’s wedding gown was an indicator of a content bias
resulting from the well recognized gender gap in participation
[1]. Wagner et al. [15] analyzed article content bias on multiple
dimensions and noted that biography articles about men and

women were not handled in an equivalent manner. The study
showed that biographies of women on Wikipedia tend to be
more linked to men while the reciprocal links from men’s
biographies were not as prevalent. Additionally, relationships
and family-related issues are more discussed in women’s
biographies than in men’s [15]. Analysis of metadata, language
and network structure of women’s biographies suggest that
there is a gender bias that can be due not only to the external
behaviors of society but also that this bias stems from the
internal generation of content on Wikipedia. [6].
With this prior work in mind, our research is designed to link
specific deletions to uncover (or discover) if the encyclopedia is
marked by systematic bias from a behavioral perspective. The
gender gap in editor participation motivates us to think that if
there are some specific systematic behavioral activities that
establish bias, then we should be able to find them directed at
content that is supposedly of interest to women4 when compared
to similar content of supposed interest to men.

any specific Wikipedia content. We recognize this as a slight hedge on the strength
of any claims we might make later in the paper, and this is one of the limitations of
the work we have conducted. This content preference limitation is faced by all prior
work as well.

_Countering_systemic_bias
4. A careful reader might notice our somewhat pedantic use of “... content that is
supposedly of interest …” to a given gender. At this point we know of no specific
method or prior work that has established a preference by one gender or another for

Observing Biases: how and where?
Observing bias can be somewhat challenging. In a technical
sense a bias is simply when something is unbalanced, or unfair,
in statistically demonstrable way. However, in a social setting
people talk about bias in a more relativistic way. That is, we
observe bias as relative unbalance or relative unfairness. This
leads to the question – relative to what? This question matters
because of endogeneity. In the context of one specific system,
say Wikipedia, it is notoriously hard to simply observe the one
system and identify the relative bias. A common approach, one
seen in the far majority of research described above, relies on a
baseline sample from some other system as the comparator.
Those results are therefore making a claim that the bias observed
in Wikipedia is relative to what is observed in the baseline.
These claims of bias are naturally fraught with cultural or yet
other systemic biases existing in the baseline. We all need to
recognize that some biases may always be present in our
baseline and that observing a bias may not speak to all biases
present.
Another subtlety is whether the bias being observed is some
outcome or a process. To try and make this point a little clearer
we highlight the distinction through Figure 1 below.

OPENSYM, August, 2020, Madrid, Spain

Figure 1. Artifacts and processes where we might be able to
observe biases in Wikipedia.
Contributor systems like Wikipedia typically have defined
processes. These processes are mostly the actions and behaviors
of people, which sometimes include bots. The traces of those
processes can be inspected as a possible way to understand how
bias might be enacted. In Wikipedia, AfC (Article for Creation),
Edit-a-thons, and individual decisions by Wikipedia editors are
example processes that result in content being potentially
created and included in the encyclopedia. Processes like PROD,
(Proposed Deletion), AfD (Article for Deletion), and CSD
(Criteria for speedy delete) are examples of processes that result
in content removal. Figure 1 illustrates these different processes
as arrows.
Figure 1 suggests an alternative to studying bias in the
processes, and that is studying or comparing content. This
alternative sits partially in and partially out of the main, public
article space because understanding biases by studying the
content also requires an external baseline set of content for
comparison.
In the work that follows, we focus on the arrow, the
processes, on the right side of Figure 1. These are processes that
result in the deletion or removal of content and we seek to
understand how bias might be enacted there. Clearly, there are
other potential sources for behavioral bias, such as bias on input
processes, but this research leaves those for another study.

Collecting Data on Deletions
The focus of this work is to understand whether there are
specific differences in the number of deletions as a function of
whether content is of supposed interest to women or men. This
requires identifying a broad set of Wikipedia article pages that
may have interest to a given gender, and then for that broad set
of articles, assess the rates of deletion. There is a quirk in pursuit
of this answer as we foreshadowed above. That is, there is
possible content that was previously in Wikipedia, but which
does not currently have an article. The method that we have
adopted has curiously helped resolve that subtle issue.
We adopted the method described in Menking et al. [12].
Their method was designed to assess “topical
representativeness” broadly across many potential topics in
Wikipedia. One example case in the paper focused on potential
bias in content of supposed interest to men or women. Following
their method, we identified a set of popular magazines whose
declared readership is primarily men or women. We used

Z. Worku et al.
EBSCO, a commercial indexing service, to collect meta-data for
all of the content published in the selected magazines during
2014 and 2004. We bifurcated the meta-data depending upon
whether it originated in magazines with primarily men or
women readership, keeping the years separate, and then
extracted the list of keywords (terms), removing any duplicates
in each list. For each year, the men's and women's targeted term
lists were compared, removing any identical terms that were
present in both lists. In general, term lists have more terms than
could be manually matched (as described in the Menking et al.
paper). We took a random sample of terms from men's and
women's term lists for both 2004 and 2014. We followed the
procedure outlined in Menking et al. [12] for matching terms to
likely articles.
We included terms from 2014 to see how a potential
systematic bias might influence topics and articles that are more
contemporary. Articles associated with terms from 2014 have the
advantage of being more recent and thus potentially included in
the encyclopedia at a time where norms were well understood,
and reference materials are readily available. Articles associated
with 2014 terms also face a disadvantage due to their novelty
which might detrimentally impact their notability. In contrast,
we included terms from 2004 in order to see how topics and their
associated articles may have persisted across a longer stretch of
time. A systematic bias would potentially impact these articles
more severely as repeated efforts to remove or delete the content
despite potential notability. Further, articles associated with
terms from 2004 may (or may not) have survived the
documented shift in notability standards for inclusion that the
encyclopedia made in the early 2000s.
We recognized that the longevity of a given topic might also
have a significant impact on notability and inclusion (or
deletion) of a given article. We used our terms from 2004 and
2014 (the most recent year for which data was available when we
conducted the study) to create a third set of terms that we call
the decadal set (2004-2014). These are terms that occur in 2004
and also occur in 2014 for the respective men’s and women's
bifurcated lists of terms. Interestingly, there were many more
men's terms that persist for the decade. However, both sets of
decadal terms were small enough that we were able to include all
of them. We repeated the article matching procedure for our
decadal terms.
The data collection so far had generated three sets of terms,
2014, 2004, decadal, bifurcated by assumed interest to a target
gender, with each term either associated with an article in
Wikipedia or noted that there was no associated article. The next
step was to collect deletions associated with the given
articles/terms. The method nicely resolves the quirky problem of
how to consider topics that are not in the encyclopedia. Given
that our set of terms were all generated and sampled in the same
way, we can use the unmatched terms—terms where we were
not able to identify an associated article—to consider potential
content that was present at one time but which is currently
deleted.
We relied on Wikipedia’s public deletion logs for Articles for
Deletion (AfDs) and Speedy Deletes (CSDs) to collect the

samples.

deletion information for all of the matched articles and for the
unmatched terms. We resolved potential AfDs using Wikipedia’s
native search focused on the on-wiki AfD discussions. We
manually conducted a search for each term, and recorded if a
result revealed that an article had ever been nominated for
deletion and how many times it had been nominated. If the
search resulted in one or more nominations, we would record
the separate logs for all nominations. We resolved potential
CSDs using the Wikimedia Foundation Quarry5 tool to query the
deletion logs. Quarry queries “a set of live replica SQL databases
of public Wikimedia Wikis.” Our Quarry queries were focused
on the English edition and were structured to consider all
possible deletions for matched articles and unmatched terms. As
in the case of the AfD logs, if an article or term6 had one or more
CSD-related records we logged the record.

Comparing Systematic Deletions
Bluntly, there does not appear to be significant qualitative
differences in the rates of AfD or CSD for articles of supposed
interest to women compared to articles of supposed interest to
men. We compare our data as ratios (percentages) because the
numbers of terms/articles across our sets varies. Table 1
summarizes the number of terms, matched articles, AfDs and
CSDs across terms for 2004, 2014 and decadal. The table
represents the ratios both as a function of the total terms and as
a function of terms matched to articles. Further, logged
arguments for proposed deletions were also largely consistent
across the articles presumed to be of interested to men and those
presumed to be of interest to women. We consider each group of
terms in more detail.

2014 Articles and Terms
For the 2014 terms, we found that articles presumed to be of
interest to women had a slightly higher deletion rate for both the
AfD and CSD processes. Under the AfD process, articles of

records, as in the method of Menking et al., there might not be an exact match

presumed interest to women had between 3.2% to 4.8% rate of
being nominated, while articles presumed to be of interest to
men ranged from 3.0% to 3.6% rate of nomination for AFD.7 The
CSD process is more aggressive, roughly nominating twice as
many articles across both sets. Articles of supposed interest to
women nominated for CSD ranged from 7.6% to 11.2%, while
articles of supposed interest to men ranged from 6.9% to 8.1%.
From our initial list of topics of supposed interest to women,
about 31.9% of topics could not be matched to an article using
the matching method, and 15.1% of terms of supposed interest to
men were in the same condition. These represent potential
content that is not currently in Wikipedia. Our search for these
generated only a few terms that came from the men’s list only.
There were no (zero) unmatched terms from the list of possible
interest to women that resulted in a match with deleted content
in the AfD and CSD logs. However, it is important to note that
the numbers of terms, which may have had a corresponding
article, and which are now deleted, is exceedingly small. Because
the numbers are small we have combined the counts for AfD and
CSD in Table 1.

2004 Articles and Terms
For the 2004 terms, the relative ranges and difference
between AfD nominations for articles of supposed interest to
women and those of supposed interest to men were very nearly
the same as those for the 2014 articles. The real difference
showed up in articles of supposed interest to men that were
nominated for CSD. Articles of possible interest to men were
nominated for CSD at a rate between 9.0% and 11.0% while for
articles possibly of interest to women were only nominated from
between 3.1% to 3.9%. This is a rather large difference even
considering the relatively small numbers in our total sample.
That content of supposed interest to men is more likely to be
nominated for CSD runs contrary to common ideas regarding
biases in content.
between term and deleted (or absent) article. In those cases, we attempted to apply
the matching method (Menking et al., 2017) as best possible as judged by the authors.
7. The ranges reflect whether the denominator of the ratio is either the total number
of terms (low end) or just the matched (or unmatched) set of terms (high end).

OPENSYM, August, 2020, Madrid, Spain
When we consider the terms that were not matched with
articles from the 2004 lists, again, there were a few terms
reflecting deleted content that came from the terms reflecting
content of possible interest to men, and no (zero) terms that
matched deleted content of supposed interest to women. Like the
2014 terms, we combined both AfD and CSD counts because the
total numbers were so small.

Decadal Articles and Terms
Recall, our decadal terms reflect terms from the respective
men's or women's interest term lists that were present in both
2004 and also appearing in 2014, and which were not part of the
random selection of terms for either 2004 or 2014 term lists. As
such, these terms reflect topics that have demonstrated some
longevity in the indexed sources.
The decadal terms showed very little difference in rates of
articles nominated for deletion between articles that had been
matched for possible interest to men and women. Interestingly,
unlike the individual rates of 2004 and 2014 matched articles,
where articles of supposed interest to women were nominated at
a slightly higher rate, the decadal terms revealed that it was
articles of supposed interest to men that were nominated at a
higher rate.
Our results show a very small difference in CSD nomination
rates for the terms that were not matched to Wikipedia articles
in the first part of our process. Unlike the unmatched terms for
2004 and 2014, the decadal terms of possible interest to women
yielded a very low number of deleted pages, while the rate of
deleted pages matching unmatched terms for men was consistent
with the rates for 2004 and 2014 terms.

Considering AfD, CSD and Multiple Deletion
Comments
We were somewhat surprised that our deletion data did not
reveal a systematic bias. While the data hints at some issues,
there are some clear instances where topics of likely interest to
men are under more deletion threat. We took a closer look at the
comments for deletion nomination, and comments in the
deletion log, to try and understand whether small numbers were
hiding a systematic bias that might be uncovered through careful
qualitative reading.
AfD Nomination Comments
We did not observe any blatant differences in the language
used to propose deletions for articles presumed to be of interest
to men or women, but one thing we did note was the
surprisingly high count of articles deleted on April 1st, or what
is popularly known as April Fool’s day in the US. It is hard to
know whether to take these nominations seriously. However,
nominating a page for deletion could be perceived as a type of
content harassment. That the nomination was performed on a
day where practical joking is to be expected may simply provide
cover for potential harassment.

Z. Worku et al.
CSD (Speedy Deletion) Deletion Comments
CSD or Speedy Delete is a process to quickly and
permanently remove content that no one contests deleting.
When articles are deleted through CSD, administrators enter a
deletion comment in a log. We considered the comments for all
of the articles that were removed through CSD. The far majority
of the articles deleted were deleted using criterion G6, also
known as general technical deletions. Wikipedia CSD policy
defines this as “uncontroversial maintenance.” About 70.4
percent of articles nominated at least once for speedy deletion
across our three sets of terms were done so as a part of the
technical deletions.
The second most common reason for a CSD deletion was A7,
which is identified as articles having “no indication of
importance (people, animals, organizations, web content,
events).” These articles are removed essentially because they do
not meet Wikipedia notability requirements.
Multiple Deletions
Across all three datasets, there were a few instances of
articles being deleted or nominated for deletion two or more
times. Some articles were nominated and/or deleted through the
same process, and some articles were nominated and/or deleted
multiple times through both AfD and CSD processes. We did not
observe any differences in these articles or terms being targeted
for deletion based on whether the articles were of supposed
interest to men or women.

DISCUSSION
Our goal with this work was to look for possible deletion
behaviors that suggest a systematic bias relative to content. Prior
work has suggested that efforts to delete content could be
considered a type of harassment or assault on that content.
Further, prior work has suggested sets of strong biases against
content that might be of more interest to women. Therefore, our
working hypothesis was that by considering specific deletion
activities we might be able to see a systematic bias against
content that was possibly of more interest to women.
These deletion data do not show a strong, systematic, bias
resulting from deletion activity. While the data for 2004 and 2014
show slightly higher AfD nomination rates for content of
possible interest to women, while CSD rates are mixed and have
content of interest to men more heavily nominated for 2004
content. Further, considering content that is not in the
encyclopedia, across all samples, content of possible interest to
men was more likely deleted. However, to be fair, there is more
content of possible interest to women that was, likely, never
included and therefore it is not possible for it to be deleted.
A more positive interpretation of our results would be that
content that is supposedly of more interest to women is staying
in the encyclopedia once it is included. Our result clearly follows
from, and supports, findings by Wagner et al. who found that
biographies of women scientists were more globally notable [16].
Our result covers a wider selection of topics, an may highlight
that the potential difficulty of getting content inserted may pay

some dividends in that less work is required to keep the content
in the encyclopedia.
Given that our modest quantitative study did not yield a clear
distinction, we took a little time to dig into some of the more
qualitative aspects of the deletions. First, we considered the
biographies and whether some biographies are more likely to be
nominated. Second, we considered in the cases of CSD what
types of reasons were given for the deletion when administrators
took a deletion action.

Further, the Wikimedia Foundation has been backing a large
number of community driven Edit-a-thons as a way to broaden
participation. These Edit-a-thons are an interesting and explicit
content inclusion process. It seems a clear follow-on study would
be to consider whether content that takes this alternate route to
inclusion is fully included or whether it suffers from some biases
from either not being accepted into the main article content
space or whether it is under deletion process assault from day
one.

strong biases related to biographies [6, 15,16]. Over all three sets
of terms, 11.4% of articles deleted, or nominated for deletion,
were biographies. We extracted names from both men’s and
women’s lists to see if there were differences in nominations or
deletions between groups. In this case there were more
biographies originating on the list of terms of possible interest to
men either nominated for deletion or deleted. We speculate, that
this is more reflective of an act of omission. That is, biographies
that might be of more interest to women are perhaps not being
deleted or nominated for deletion simply because they are not
there in the first place.

Behaviors that stem from systemic bias are often pernicious
at best, and malicious at their worst because gender bias is so
embedded in culture. Malicious forms of bias towards women on
Wikipedia has been well-documented in numerous accounts of
online harassment. These attacks blatantly expose dangerous
attitudes and threats against women. In the case of deletions, we
were not able to find this kind of deliberate, mal-intended attack
on topics presumed to be of interest to women. Through our
qualitative look at deletion log records we found no indication of
targeted harassment in the arguments for deletion. Malicious
exclusionary attitudes and practices around content exist, but
our findings suggest that deletion talk pages are not generally
where they play out. A large-scale trend of women’s topics being
deleted more frequently would have given us an understanding
of some more pernicious behaviors that can be tied back to
systemic bias. In the context of Wikipedia, we urge that future
work should be done around the more pernicious ways that
system bias is reinforced.

Article Redirects
Prior work shows that a higher proportion terms of likely
interest to women redirect to a topic that may or not be of
interest to women [12]. The nature of a redirect is that two
separate terms are determined to mean essentially the same
thing. However, this consolidation of terms might have some
gendered consequences. For instance, a search for "Stewardess"
currently redirects to "Flight Attendant." While Flight Attendant
is the currently accepted term for this career, the reality is that
this policy essentially erases cultural knowledge and historical
perspectives related to women that is not captured once terms
are homogenized. This suggests that future work for
understanding systemic bias should include further investigation
of redirects.

Bias and Content Inclusion Processes
As we attempted to distinguish in Figure 1, when examining
biases one can attempt to focus on either the existing content or
the surrounding processes related to content inclusion and
deletion. This study considered key deletion processes.
Critical processes related to the way that content is included
in the encyclopedia remain to be studied. One possible way to
study content inclusion and potential systematic bias is to study
the Article for Creation (WP:AfC)8 process. Through AfC, users
request that an article be created. This process might expose the
types of articles that are not included in the encyclopedia, and
simultaneously understand which potential new articles are
being ignored—a different potential explanation for content bias
if deletion processes can be ruled out.
